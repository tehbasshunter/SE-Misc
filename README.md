This is a collection of pre-made templates for users to simulate various alert types as you would normally do with the overlay editor using a Streamdeck.


# These are only designed for Twitch and Streamdecks.


To import these you will need to install the [API Ninja plugin](https://marketplace.elgato.com/product/api-ninja-fd59edeb-e7e5-412f-91ef-304c3e03f035) from the elgato marketplace.
Then add an action from the plugin entry and choose the import option from the bottom of the action settings.
